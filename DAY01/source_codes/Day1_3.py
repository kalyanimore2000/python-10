# Variables and constants
# in python we dont use constants
# but if we wish to declare any variable as constant
# it is just a convention (not compulsory to be followed)
# if any variable name is written in CAPITAL
# its the programmers duty not to change the data

num = 45
PI = 3.14; # convention is followed that please keep PI as constant
print(num)
print(PI)
num = num+1
print(num)
